# Lorenz-System
Using Euler's method to solve and visualize the Lorenz system.


Using Euler's method to solve the Lorenz system numerically. The accuracy of the simulation is controlled by the "fact" variable, 
higher values lead to slower but more accurate simulations.

It is then visualized for the cases of 2D, 3D, and animated.
