# Lorenz-System
Using Euler's method to solve and visualize the Lorenz system.


I use Euler's method to solve the Lorenz system numerically. The accuracy of the simulation is controlled by the "fact" variable, 
higher values lead to slower but more accurate simulations.

I then visualized the simulation for 3 scenarios, 2D, 3D, and animated.
